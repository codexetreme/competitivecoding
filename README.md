# What this repo is about 

This repo contains my approaches to leetcode style problems on various different platforms. 

More often than not, I may have missed a few edge cases, or adapted solutions that dont have a perfect resolution to the 
problem at hand. If this is the case, if you are interested to help me, please on a issue pointing out my mistakes, and
I will be much obliged.
